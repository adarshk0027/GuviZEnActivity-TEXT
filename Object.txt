 objects and its internal representation in Javascript

Objects are the representation of real-world entities in any language 
representing things by defining its properties along with their values. 
In Javascript, objects may be defined as an unordered collection of related data,
 of primitive or reference types, in the form of “key: value” pairs.

we can list the values and seperated by Commas.and we Can Also use {} for creating objects
*) object creation

var person={id:"1",name:"ADARSH",age:50,display:function()};

id , name,age .display are keys used in object.
we can include diffrent type of values.

 *)Object.create()

The method creates a new object, using an existing object as the prototype of
 the newly created object.
using the object literal example as prototype-
var car2 = Object.create(car);
car.id=2; 

*)ASSIGNING

we can get the values using keys and also use . operator for that
eg:
obj1.name;
obj1.age;

Then we can assign a another value to a key in an object.
if a key name has a value "adarsh" ,then we want to update that by Gopi.
object is person then,
person.name="Gopi";


we can also include a function in object.if display is a key and value is a 
function. And the object is person Then,we can call that function by 

person.display();

* we can also get a value by using [];

ie,a person object have an key id and its value is 4 then we can get id by

person[id];
