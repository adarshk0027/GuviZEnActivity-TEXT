Diffrense Between HTTP1.1 VS HTTP2
--------------------------------------

The Hypertext Transfer Protocol, or HTTP, is an application protocol That
was developed in 1989.HTTP2.0 is the latest.It comes in 2015.
which offered several methods to decrease latency, especially when dealing with mobile platforms 
and server-intensive graphics and videos.Http is a client server based protocol.
It is worked By request passiing to the server and Response get by the server.

HTTP/1.1
___________
Developed by Timothy Berners-Lee in 1989 as a communication standard for the 
World Wide Web, HTTP is a top-level application protocol that exchanges 
information between a client computer and a local or remote web server. 
In this process, a client sends a text-based request to a server by calling a 
method like GET or POST. In response, the server sends a resource like an 
HTML page back to the client.
web server returns an HTML page to the requesting client, in addition 
to any images, stylesheets, or other resources called for in the HTML. 
Note that not all of the resources are returned to the client in the first
call for data.


HTTP/2
_____________

HTTP/2 began as the SPDY protocol, developed primarily at Google with the
 intention of reducing web page load latency by using techniques such as 
compression, multiplexing, and prioritization.HTTP/2 will make our applications 
faster, simpler, and more robust .
, HTTP/2 modifies how the data is formatted (framed) and transported 
between the client and server, both of which manage the entire process, 
and hides all the complexity from our applications within the new framing 
layer.
